  <h1>The Giant Squid</h1>
  <h2><em>Scientists find Giant squid</em></h2>
	
	<blockquote><p>The <strong>giant squid</strong> (genus: <em>Architeuthis</em>) is a 
	deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family <em>Architeuthidae</em>, represented by as many as <em>eight species.</em> Giant squid can grow to a tremendous size (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep-sea_gigantism">Deep-sea gigantism</a>): recent estimates put the maximum size at 13 m (43 ft) for females and 10 m (33 ft) for males from the posterior fins to the tip of the two long tentacles (second only to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_squid">colossal squid</a> at an estimated 14 m (46 ft), one of the largest living organisms). The mantle is about 2 m (6.6 ft) long (more for females, less for males), and the length of the squid excluding its tentacles is about 5 m (16 ft). Claims of specimens measuring 20 m (66 ft) or more have not been scientifically documented.</p></blockquote>

	 took the first images of a live giant squid in its natural habitat. Several of the 556 photographs were released a year later. The 
	 		<a href="http://www.thediscovery.org/">NMNS</a> and 
	 		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogasawara_Whale_Watching_Association">OWA</a> successfully filmed a live adult giant squid for the first time on 4 December 2006.</p>
